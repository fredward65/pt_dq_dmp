# Projectile Throwing Dual Quaternion Dynamic Movement Primitives
A simulation on a UR-5 running on ROS-Industrial + Gazebo.

The robot executes a throwing motion through a DQ-DMP model.

This repository was developed to support the article (currently in review) titled

> An Improved Dual Quaternion Dynamic Movement Primitives Based Algorithm for Robot-Agnostic Learning and Execution of Throwing Tasks
